/**
 * Two-phase client registry.
 *
 * `POST /register` is unauthenticated by RFC 7591, so anyone on the internet can
 * call it. New registrations are therefore provisional: they carry a TTL, they
 * count against a hard cap, and the oldest is evicted once that cap is reached.
 * A client becomes permanent only once an allowlisted human has completed an
 * authorization with it, and permanent entries never expire and are never
 * evicted. Anonymous traffic can consume at most `maxProvisional` slots.
 *
 * Provisional entries are persisted rather than held in memory. Clients cache
 * the `client_id` they were issued and do not re-register when it stops being
 * recognised, so a restart between registration and first authorization would
 * otherwise break a client permanently. The cap is what bounds disk use here;
 * keeping them in memory only bought durability problems, not safety.
